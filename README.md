There are 4 tools here.

I may update their description when using them but they should be visible when in the app

Date calculator: Calculates the time between two dates in days. (Few things needs fixed)
Compound Interest Calculator: Calculates interest when compounded. (Needs more work)
Fibonacci Calculator: Calculates which Fibonacci number to calculate. #1 is 1, #2 is 1, #3 is 2, #4 is 3 etc.
Countdown Timer: This will let you set a countdown timer

There's not much else to say. But This is for python practice
